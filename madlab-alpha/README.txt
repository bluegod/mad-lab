Mad-Lab - Readme File -

This is a very first version of Mad-Lab,
it's just a project for a course where
I can't use Swing, so it is completely 
coded in AWT.

Project is in a very early stage and by
the way a bit buggy. Much effor will be
needed to rewrite it in Swing, add more
features (really needed) and fix the
bugs.

Although the documentation and comments
were made in English the program is in
SPANISH language.

The TODO-List from this very first
version is:

- Rewrite components using Swing instead
of AWT only.
- Translate to English / Multilingual
version.
- Fix bugs
- Add charts support with JFreeChart
- Add a mathematical formula parser
- Add statistical methods.
- Add functions & mathematical symbols
to a "formula editor".

After doing such things a beta version 
could be released as the "main" features
would be covered.
