**Mad Lab** is a Descriptive Statistical software. It generates randomized data given a _possible_ "average result" and a list of _supposed_ deviations. In short, a person suppose an average result (mean), and what the uncertainties could be, so it generates a list of randomized imaginary results.

As the diagram shows it is the inverse process of a real experiment observation. So the challenge is to have a set of observational data without "doing" the experiment itself.
